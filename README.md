# Sister Help: Data Augmentation for Frame-Semantic Role Labeling

Sister Help is a frame-specific implementation of FrameNet lexicographic data augmentation for use with existing SRL systems as outlined in our paper, [Sister Help: Data Augmentation for Frame-Semantic Role Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07725). Augmented data generated by this code that was used in our experiment may be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zxd_cAMBRuEtPp52skGFlNprpAWBTjCk/view?usp=sharing) as a ZIP archive of the reannotated lexical unit XML files.

Full README coming soon -- stay tuned!
